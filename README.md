# Energy Consumption Predictive Model

  - The purpose of this project was to predict energy consumption based on various factors, such as Temperature, HVAC Usage, Occupancy Level, and Lighting Usage. We worked with both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models.
    
  - This project highlights the following approaches:
    
      - 1) Identifying a dataset to work with
      - 2) Cleaning the data
      3) Performing EDA
      4) Performing Feature Engineering
      5) Scaling of Numerical Data
      6) Encoding Categorical Data
      7) Running multiple iterations of Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression models, which includes hyperparameter tuning, adjustments of the training/test set ratio and adjustments of features
      8) Creating visualizations of the data to tell the story of how our best model performed
